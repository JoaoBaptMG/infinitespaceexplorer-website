        <h1 class="text-center mt48">About Us</h1>
        <p><img src="img/ship1.png" class="pull-left desc-img"><strong>JOÃO BAPTISTA<small>/software and business</small></strong><br>I have always been fascinated with games and their complexity, and I always wanted to know how they worked. When I was 9, the Internet presented me with RPG Maker, which was my first tool to make games. However, I discovered a passion for programming and I decided to join this passion with my always-standing dream of making games.</p>
        <p><img src="img/ship2.png" class="pull-right desc-img"><strong>LUCAS RESENDE<small>/graphics and website</small></strong><br>Just trying to be a designer, a programmer and a mathematician, not in order. I joined the group as a hobby and my mainly function was to delay the project where and when I can, by not sending sprites in time and saying "almost done" when I have neither started. But i swear, it is not my fault if the game delayed one year.</p>
        <p><img src="img/ship3.png" class="pull-left desc-img"><strong>MARCELO HIPÓLITO<small>/music and sound</small></strong><br>I have always been in contact with music, but I never thought I would start composing tracks for games. It all began when I posted a query on a gaming forum in the internet. I started chatting with a programmer who is also a musician, and he introduced me to the market of music composition for games. Since then, I have combined the love I already had for games with the love for music.</p>
